This file describes the data used and steps utilized to manipulate the raw data.

DATA SOURCE

See ReadMe.md file for original collection methodology and data source

ORIGINAL IMPORT

Six csv files were imported from the original data set download. There are two set of data for the Test and Training groups.

X_test (2947 obs, 561 var) - contains all experiment data for the test group
Y_test (2947 obs, 1 var) - contains the activity listing for the test group
subject_test (2947 obs, 1 var) - contains the subject IDs for the test group

These three files were imported using read.table function and combined into a single table (Test) by column using cbind. There
are 2947 observations in the table with 563 variables.

X_train (7352 obs, 561 var) - contains all experiment data for the training group
Y_train (7352 obs, 1 var) - contains the activity listing for the training group
subject_train (7352 obs, 1 var) - contains the subject IDs for the training group

These three files were imported using read.table function and combined into a single table (Training) by column using cbind. 
There are 7452 observations in the table with 563 variables.

COMBINED TABLE

The Test group data table and the Training group data table were further combined into one table (alldata) using rbind. The
combined table has 10299 observations with 563 variables.

The column headings were revised based on the features.txt listing included in the original dataset download. Code was
written in Excel using concatenate. Illegal characters [, (), and -] were removed during this step.

A subset that only includes the mean and standard deviation columns was selected to create the MSdata table using grep. The
MSdata table has 10299 observations with 82 variables.

A new column ActivityName was added to provide description of the activities performed based on the Activity code as follows:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The final scheme for the MSData table is as follows:

Subject (char) - Subject ID
ActivityName (char) - Activity performed

The following numeric columns include the measurements based on each subject and activity. The units are radians/second.

SUMMARY TABLE

A final summary table (MSDataSummary) was created to summarize the average of each column of numeric data by Subject and ActivityName
using ddply and colwise.

The MSDataSummary table includes 180 observations with 82 variables.
